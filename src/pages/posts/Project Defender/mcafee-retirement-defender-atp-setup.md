**Defender ATP Setup: High-Level Overview**

I'd like to take this opportunity to especially thank everyone that made this happen, you all know who you are! (will most likely post a team photo). Personally, this is monumental to my career. I've done other projects for this company but wow, this was quite an accomplishment and we're only half way to flip

Most likely this will be an on-going post that I will need to keep working on the weekends.
